# Cafe-Choco-Latte
Assignment 1 in the course Dynamic Web Applications with focus on HTML5 elements.

## Goal of the website
To reach customers who love high quality coffee and chocolate in various forms by
communicating who runs the café and what you can get from it by showing menus and
services.

## Target group
Everyone is welcome to the café, but since the quality of what we serve is slightly higher
than a regular café, prices are also somewhat higher. The main target group
is therefore people aged 30-55 who seek that something extra in their daily life.

### Persona 1 - Daniel
Daniel is 33 years old and has been working as a real estate agent for 4 years.
His major interests are architecture and coffee, which has made many
vacations spent in various European cities where he visits houses
with exciting architecture and cafes with very good quality coffee. He thinks of
himself as a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to coffee and has a particular thought
of how it should taste.

### Persona 2 - Kristin
Kristin is 40 years old and owns a web agency with 7 employees. The small amount of
free time that she has is spent either on being out in the nature, or on shopping
with friends. She likes to have business meetings in the city in cozy cafes where
good chocolate cakes are served since Kristin loves everything with chocolate in it.

## Content
The site must, of course, contain information about the café (such as opening hours, history and information about
the owners), its menu and the ability to book a chocolate tasting session. Besides the chocolate
you also want information about its origin and the different varieties that are available. Pictures
of coffee and chocolate that creates a craving for the costumer to come and visit the café should be present.
